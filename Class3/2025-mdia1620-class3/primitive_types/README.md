### What Are Primitive Types?

Think of **primitive types** like the **basic building blocks** or **LEGO bricks** of your code. They're the **simplest types of data** in JavaScript, and they can't be broken down into smaller pieces.

Here are the **7 primitive types**, explained simply:

---

### 1. **String** – Words or Text

**Example:** `"Hello"` or `"Pizza is yummy"`
🗣️ *It's like writing something in quotation marks. It's just text!*

```javascript
let name = "SpongeBob";
```

---

### 2. **Number** – Numbers

**Example:** `5`, `3.14`, `-10`
🔢 *Used for math, counting, or measuring.*

```javascript
let age = 10;
```

---

### 3. **Boolean** – True or False

**Example:** `true` or `false`
✅❌ *It's like answering a yes-or-no question.*

```javascript
let isHungry = true;
```

---

### 4. **Undefined** – Not Given a Value Yet

**Example:** `undefined`
*It’s like a box with nothing inside because you haven’t put anything in yet.*

```javascript
let toy; // No value given yet
```

---

### 5. **Null** – Nothing on Purpose

**Example:** `null`
🕳️ *This is like saying, “This box is empty because I want it to be empty.”*

```javascript
let favoriteColor = null;
```

---

### 6. **Symbol** – A Secret Name

**Example:** `Symbol("id")`
🕵️ *It's like giving something a secret label that no one else can copy.*

```javascript
let id = Symbol("userID");
```

---

### 7. **BigInt** – Super Huge Numbers

**Example:** `1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n`
📦 *Used when numbers are too big for normal math.*

```javascript
let starsInUniverse = 123456789123456789123456789n;
```
